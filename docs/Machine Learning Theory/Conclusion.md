### The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning

*Let $H$ be a hypothesis class of functions from a domain $X$ to $\{0, 1\}$ and let the loss function be the 0-1 loss. Then, the following are equivalent:*
1. *$H$ has the uniform convergence property.*
2. *Any ERM rule is a successful agnostic PAC learner for $H$.*
3. *$H$ is agnostic PAC learnable.*
4. *$H$ is PAC learnable.*
5. *Any ERM rule is a successful PAC learner $H$.*
6. *H has a finite VC-dimension.*
