### Theorem

*Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers, and let $n>k$. Suppose we have to place $n$ identical balls into $k$ identical boxes. Then there will be at least one box in which we place at least two balls.*

#### Proof by Contradiction

Let us assume there is no box with at least two balls. Then each of the $k$ boxes has either 0 or 1 ball in it. Denote by $m$ the number of boxes that have zero balls in them; then certainly $m \geq 0$. Then, of course, there are $k-m$ boxes that have one. However, that would mean that the total number of balls placed into the $k$ boxes is $k-m$ which is a contradiction because we had to place $n$ balls into the boxes, and $kâˆ’m \leq k < n$. Therefore, our assumption that there is no box with at least two balls must have been false.

### Theorem (Generalized Pigeon-hole Principle)

Let $n, m$, and $r$ be positive integers so that $n>r m$, and let us distribute $n$ identical balls into $m$ identical boxes. Then there will be at least one box into which we place at least $r+1$ balls.

#### Proof

Just as before, we assume the contrary statement. Then each of the $m$ boxes can hold at most $r$ balls, so all the boxes can hold at most $r m<n$ balls, which contradicts the requirement that we distribute $n$ balls.

### Components of Inductive Proof

Inductive proof is composed of 3 major parts : Base Case, Induction Hypothesis, Inductive Step.
1. **Base Case:** One or more particular cases that represent the most basic case. (e.g. $n=1$ to prove a statement in the range of positive integer)
2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assumption that we would like to be based on. (e.g. Let's assume that $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{k})$ holds)
3. **Inductive Step:** Prove the next step based on the induction hypothesis. (i.e. Show that Induction hypothesis $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{k})$ implies $\mathrm{P}(\mathrm{k}+1)$)

### Weak Induction, Strong Induction

The difference between weak induction and strong indcution only appears in induction hypothesis. In weak induction, we only assume that particular statement holds at $k$-th step, while in strong induction, we assume that the particular statment holds at all the steps from the base case to $k$-th step.
