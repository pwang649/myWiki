## Problem 1

### DO/for Directive

```c
omp_set_num_threads(4);
#pragma omp parallel shared(data_point) reduction(+: num_of_points_in_circle) private(i)
{
    #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic, 10000000) nowait
    for (i = 0; i < num_of_points; i++)
    {
        if ((data_point[i].x - 0.5) * (data_point[i].x - 0.5) + (data_point[i].y - 0.5) * (data_point[i].y - 0.5) <= 0.25)
        {
            num_of_points_in_circle++;
        }
    }
    
}
```

### SECTIONS Directive

```c
omp_set_num_threads(2);
#pragma omp parallel shared(data_point) reduction(+: num_of_points_in_circle) private(i)
{
    #pragma omp sections nowait
    {
        #pragma omp section
        {
            for (i = 0; i < num_of_points/2; i++)
            {
                if ((data_point[i].x - 0.5) * (data_point[i].x - 0.5) + (data_point[i].y - 0.5) * (data_point[i].y - 0.5) <= 0.25)
                {
                    num_of_points_in_circle++;
                }
            }
        }
        #pragma omp section
        {
            for (i = num_of_points/2; i < num_of_points; i++)
            {
                if ((data_point[i].x - 0.5) * (data_point[i].x - 0.5) + (data_point[i].y - 0.5) * (data_point[i].y - 0.5) <= 0.25)
                {
                    num_of_points_in_circle++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Problem 3

### Comparison

| # of threads | PHW2 | PHW3 |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1** | 0.502734 sec | 0.569594 sec |
| **2** | 0.404511 sec | 0.366488 sec |
| **4** | 0.341998 sec | 0.254956 sec |
| **8** | 0.322975 sec | 0.249094 sec |

### Analysis

For the newer method, the execution time is down for threads of more than one. This is because we don't need to create new threads for each iteration and join all threads at the end of each iteration. Now we just need to create the threads once and inside each thread to perform the iterations, after all, join all threads once. This saves a lot of unnecessary overheads during the execution of threads creation and exit. The only exception is when we only have one thread.
