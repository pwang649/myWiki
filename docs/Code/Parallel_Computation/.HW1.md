### Question 1

Explain the following terms:
1. **Temporal locality**: Repeated reference to a data item in a small time window.
2. **Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) Processor**: It relies on the compiler to resolve dependencies and resource availability at compile time. Instructions that can be executed concurrently are packed into groups and parceled off to the processor as a single long instruction word (thus the name) to be executed on multiple functional units at the same time.
3. **Single instruction multiple data (SIMD)**: A single control unit dispatches instructions to each processing unit.
4. **Cache hit ratio**: The fraction of data references satisfied by the cache.
5. **Memory bound computation**: Computations that are mainly hindered by the rate at which data can be pumped into the CPU.
6. **Cache line**: A contiguous block of data returned from a single memory request.
7. **Instruction-level parallelism**: the parallel or simultaneous execution of a sequence of instructions in a computer program.
8. **Data dependencies**: The results of an instruction may be required for subsequent instructions.
9. **Superscalar processor**: The ability of a processor to issue multiple instructions in the same cycle.
10. **Column major layout**: Consecutive elements of a column reside next to each other in a memory system.
