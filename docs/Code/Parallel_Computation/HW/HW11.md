### Question 1

- **EREW PRAM**: Exclusive Read, Exclusive Write Parallel Random Access Machine, where only one processor can write to or read from a memory location in any step.
- **CREW PRAM**: Concurrent Read, Exclusive Write Parallel Random Access Machine. Similar to EREW, but allows for multiple processors to read from the same memory location concurrently
- **CRCW PRAM**: Concurrent Read, Concurrent Write Parallel Random Access Machine, where multiple processors can read from and write to the same memory location concurrently.
- **List Ranking**: An algorithmic technique for eï¬€iciently determining the position of each element in a linked list.

### Question 2

```
Initialize:
level[root] = 0
parent[root] = root
for all nodes v != root
    level[v] = infinity
    parent[v] = null

for i = 1 to log e
    for all nodes v
        if ID[v] mod 2^i == 0
            Send level[v] and parent[v] to neighbor ID[v]+2^(i-1)
        else if ID[v] mod 2^i == 2^(i-1)
            Receive level[u] and parent[u] from neighbor ID[v]-2^(i-1)
            if level[u]+1 < level[v]
                level[v] = level[u]+1
                parent[v] = u

```

We use a CRCW PRAM model here because when a node has more than 1 parent node pointing to it, it should choose arbitrarily who should be its parent. Same for a node pointing to more than 1 child node.

### Question 3

#### Part 1

| Function Invocation | Returned Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Prefix-sum (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) | {1,3,6,10,15,21,28,36} |
| Prefix-sum (1,2,3,4) | {1,3,6,10} |
| Prefix-sum (5,6,7,8) | {5,11,18,26} |
| Prefix-sum (1,2) | {1,3} |
| Prefix-sum(3,4) | {3,7} |
| Prefix-sum(5,6) | {5,11} |
| Prefix-sum (7,8) | {7,15} |

#### Part 2

```
Prefix(X):
    if n = 1
        s = x_1
        return s
    <y_1,...,y_n/2> = Prefix(<x_1,...,x_n/2>)
    <z_1,...,y_n/2> = Prefix(<x_n/2+1,...,x_n>)
    for i from 1 to n parallel do
        if i <= n/2
            s_i = y_i
        else
            s_i = y_n/2 + z_i-n/2
    return s
```

- Total parallel time: $T(n)=T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(1)=O(n)$
- Total work done: $W(n)=W\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(n)=O(n)$.

#### Part 3

```
Prefix(X):
    if n = 1
        s = x_1
        return s
    <y_1,...,y_n/2> = Prefix(<x_1,...,x_n/2>)
    <z_1,...,y_n/2> = Prefix(<x_n/2+1,...,x_n>)
    send from y_n/2 to z_1
    for i from 1 to log(n/2) parallel do
        send z_1,...,z_2^n correspondly to z_2^n+1,...,z_2^(n+1)
    for i from 1 to n parallel do
        if i <= n/2
            s_i = y_i
        else
            s_i = y_n/2 + z_i-n/2
    return s
```

- Total parallel time: $T(n)=T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(\log n)=O\left(\log ^2 n\right)$
- Total work done: $W(n)=W\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)+O(n)=$ $O(n)$
