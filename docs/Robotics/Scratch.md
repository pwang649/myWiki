The term *robotics* was then introduced by Asimov as the science devoted to the study of robots which was based on the *three fundamental laws*:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.

#### Modeling

The formulation of the kinematics relationship allows the study of two key problems of robotics, namely, the direct kinematics problem and the in- verse kinematics problem. The former concerns the determination of a sys- tematic, general method to describe the end-effector motion as a function of the joint motion by means of linear algebra tools. The latter concerns the inverse problem.

#### Planning

The motion planning problem for a mobile robot concerns the generation of trajectories to take the vehicle from a given initial configuration to a desired final configuration.

#### Control

Realization of the motion specified by the control law requires the employment of actuators and sensors.
