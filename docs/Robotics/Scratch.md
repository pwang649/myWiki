The term *robotics* was then introduced by Asimov as the science devoted to the study of robots which was based on the *three fundamental laws*:
1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders given by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the first law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.
