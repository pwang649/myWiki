The notion of the state of a dynamic system is a fundamental notion in physics. The basic premise of newtonian dynamics is that the future evolution of a dynamic process is entirely determined by its present state, following this abstract definition:
    The state of a dynamic system is a set of physical quantities, the specification of which (in the absence of external excitation) completely determines the evolution of the system.
