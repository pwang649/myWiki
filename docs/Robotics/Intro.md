I am very excited to start this section, my favorite one, of my wiki. I will try to make this section comprehensive and elaborative, spanning various hot robotics topics such as motion planning, control, and learning. Stay tuned, as I continuously trudge through the bitter and sweet journey of robotics.

Unlike other sections, I will try to make this section more intriguing. Perhaps doing more coding, projects, and video demonstrations as oppose to cramming all the dull theories (There will for sure be some crucial theoretical concepts though).

### Need to Know

- Calculus
- Linear Algebra (*Very Important*)
- Probability Theory
- Basic Physics and Trignometry
- Coding
- A Good Understanding of How Things Work

### Books

- *Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox. Probabilistic robotics. MIT press, 2005.*
- *Bruno Siciliano, Lorenzo Sciavicco, Luigi Villani, and Giuseppe Oriolo. Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control.*
- More to come...
