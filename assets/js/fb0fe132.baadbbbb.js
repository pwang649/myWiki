I will define a couple of the common ones below.\\n\\n- Old soy sauce - \u8001\u62bd\\n- Aged vinegar - \u9648\u918b\\n- Cooking wine - \u6599\u9152\\n- Cinnamon - \u6842\u76ae\\n- Star anise - \u516b\u89d2\\n\\nMore to come ...\\n\\n### Use of Tags\\n\\n**Healthy**: Blog posts with a healthy tag consist of all healthy dishes, namely every dish that contains both veggies and meat, low oil, low salt, and low sugar.\\n\\n**Convenient**: A dish that can be cooked within 20 minutes from start to finish is categorized as a convenient dish.\\n\\n**Delicate**: Complementing the `convenient` tag, a delicate tag means that the cooking process for the dish is time-consuming and requires some skillful work.\\n\\n**Spicy**: On fire!\\n\\n**Vegan**: Veggie!\\n\\n**Seafood**: A dish that has seafood, such as fish, crabs, clams, etc., as its component. Fun fact: I\'m a super big seafood fan.\\n\\n**Pork**: A dish that uses pork as one of its ingredients.\\n\\n**Beef**: A dish that uses beef as one of its ingredients.\\n\\nThe rest of the tags are pretty literal.\\n\\n### Blog Structure\\n\\n```\\nTitle\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Food Name (with a picture)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Ingredients\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Instructions\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Adornment (with a video)\\n```\\n\\nThere\'s always a luring picture at the beginning followed by ingredients and instructions.\\n\\nPictures may not come with instructions at each step. (I\'m lazy.)\\n\\nThe adornment section is the apex of the blog, always in a form of a video. It evokes some inner satisfaction!\\n\\nEnjoy~"}]}')}}]);
