DP can rarely be used in practice because of their great cost, but are nonetheless important theoretically as all other approaches to computing the value function are, in effect, approximations of DP. DP algorithms are obtained by turning the Bellman equations into assignments, that is, into update rules for improving approximations of the desired value functions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - MC":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - MC","title":"Monte Carlo Methods","description":"What\'s Monte Carlo?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - MDP":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - MDP","title":"Markov Decision Process","description":"The Agent\u2013Environment Interface","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - n-step":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - n-step","title":"n-step Bootstrapping","description":"n-step TD Prediction","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - Overview":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - Overview","title":"Overview","description":"Book","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - PPO":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - PPO","title":"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms","description":"Intro","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - TD":{"id":"Reinforcement Learning/Reinforcement Learning - TD","title":"Temporal-Difference Learning","description":"TD learning is a combination of Monte Carlo ideas and dynamic programming (DP) ideas.
