I don\'t know whether you are drooling or \\"ew-ing\\" in front of your screen, but at least my stomach is satisfied with these dishes.\\n\\n### Terminology\\n\\nI mainly cook Chinese cuisine so there\'s a translation gap between Chinese and English cooking jargon. I will define a couple of the common ones below.\\n\\n- Old soy sauce - \u8001\u62bd\\n- Aged vinegar - \u9648\u918b\\n- Cooking wine - \u6599\u9152\\n- Cinnamon - \u6842\u76ae\\n- Star anise - \u516b\u89d2\\n\\nMore to come ...\\n\\n### Use of Tags\\n\\n**Healthy**: Blog posts with a healthy tag consist of all healthy dishes, namely every dish that contains both veggies and meat, low oil, low salt, and low sugar.\\n\\n**Convenient**: A dish that can be cooked within 20 minutes from start to finish is categorized as a convenient dish.\\n\\n**Delicate**: Complementing the `convenient` tag, a delicate tag means that the cooking process for the dish is time-consuming and requires some skillful work.\\n\\n**Spicy**: On fire!\\n\\n**Vegan**: Veggie!\\n\\n**Seafood**: A dish that has seafood, such as fish, crabs, clams, etc., as its component. Fun fact: I\'m a super big seafood fan.\\n\\n**Pork**: A dish that uses pork as one of its ingredients.\\n\\n**Beef**: A dish that uses beef as one of its ingredients.\\n\\nThe rest of the tags are pretty literal.\\n\\n### Blog Structure\\n\\n```\\nTitle\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Food Name (with a picture)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Ingredients\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Instructions\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 Adornment (with a video)\\n```\\n\\nThere\'s always a luring picture at the beginning followed by ingredients and instructions.\\n\\nPictures may not come with instructions at each step. (I\'m lazy.)\\n\\nThe adornment section is the apex of the blog, always in a form of a video. It evokes some inner satisfaction!\\n\\nEnjoy~"},{"id":"/2023/03/14/2023-03-14-abalone_rice/abalone_rice","metadata":{"permalink":"/myWiki/blog/2023/03/14/2023-03-14-abalone_rice/abalone_rice","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-14-abalone_rice/2023-03-14-abalone_rice.mdx","title":"Abalone Rice","description":"The taste from the ocean floor of the deep sea, mixed with the fresh green from the primal land, combine to produce a masterwork of delicacy.","date":"2023-03-14T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 14, 2023","tags":[{"label":"healthy","permalink":"/myWiki/blog/tags/healthy"},{"label":"seafood","permalink":"/myWiki/blog/tags/seafood"},{"label":"delicate","permalink":"/myWiki/blog/tags/delicate"}],"readingTime":1.325,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Wang","title":"Cooking Hobbyist","url":"https://pwang649.github.io","imageURL":"https://pwang649.github.io/images/bio.png","key":"peter"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Abalone Rice","authors":["peter"],"tags":["healthy","seafood","delicate"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/myWiki/blog/welcome"},"nextItem":{"title":"Sweet & Sour Pork Ribs","permalink":"/myWiki/blog/2023/03/14/2023-03-15-sweet_sour_ribs/sweet_sour_ribs"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\n> The taste from the ocean floor of the deep sea, mixed with the fresh green from the primal land, combine to produce a masterwork of delicacy.\\n\\n### Abalone Rice \u9c8d\u9c7c\u635e\u996d\\n\\n![](./abalone_rice.jpeg)\\n\\n### Ingredients\\n\\n- Abalone x6 \u9c8d\u9c7c\\n- Bok Choy/asparagus x4 \u5c0f\u9752\u83dc/\u82a6\u7b0b\\n- A bowl of cooked white rice \u7c73\u996d\\n- 1 teaspoon of oyster sauce \u869d\u6cb9\\n- 2 teaspoons of soy sauce \u751f\u62bd\\n- 1 teaspoon of old soy sauce \u8001\u62bd\\n- 2 teaspoons of cooking wine \u6599\u9152\\n- 2 teaspoons of starch \u6dc0\u7c89\\n- 1 slice of ginger \u59dc\\n- A little bit of white pepper \u767d\u80e1\u6912\\n\\n### Instructions\\n\\n1.
